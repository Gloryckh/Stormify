Stormify
========

Listen to soothing rainstorms on any Android device running Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and above. 

App was published on Google Play Store in September 2013 (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vik.linx.stormify)

Free forever. No ads. 

Development of this project has been stopped (at least temporarily) because I no longer have time to maintain it. The app will still be on Google Play and development may restart in the future.
